# Preparing Your Modpack

## Overview

Cleanroom Loader is compatible with the vast majority of Forge mods and will usually run them without issue.<br>
However, some mods remain **deprecated, redundant, or outright incompatible**—either because they’ve been superseded by better alternatives or because they introduce critical problems.<br>
To prepare your modpack for Cleanroom Loader, review the lists below and make replacements where necessary.<br>

## Incompatible / Problematic Mods on Cleanroom Launcher

::: warning {id="warning"}
If your modpack uses **Bansoukou 4**, make sure to **run the instance at least once** before installing cleanroom loader so its patches are applied.

## Performance / Memory optimization mods

The most important optimization mods for **Minecraft 1.12.2** can be summed up to the following list:
- **[CensoredASM](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lolasm)** : Huge optimizations that are targeted at Minecraft 1.12.2.
- **[VintageFix](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/vintagefix)** : Load time and RAM use improvements for Minecraft 1.12.2.
- **[Universal Tweaks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/universal-tweaks)** : A community project to consolidate various bugfixes and tweaks into a single solution for Minecraft 1.12.2.
- **[Stellar Core](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/stellarcore)** : Provides extensive bug fixes, performance improvements, and additional features across a wide range of mods.
- **[Gnetum](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gnetum)** : Improves performance by distributing HUD updates over multiple frames. <br/>(May experience a few bugs, please report them [Here](https://github.com/decce6/Gnetum/issues).)
- **[Fixeroo](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xp-orb-clump)** : Bundles bugfixes and XP orb optimizations.
- **[Alfheim Lighting Engine](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/alfheim-lighting-engine)** : Lighting engine replacement for Minecraft, optimized for performance and fixing many bugs.

::: info Note {id="note"}
Universal Tweaks supersedes a lot of mods which will be mostly not mentioned here. This can be observed via an in-game warning or by looking at the incompatible mods list [**Here**](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/universal-tweaks/files/6953147).

## Render optimization mods

The most prominent Render optimization mods for **Minecraft 1.12.2** are:

- **[OptiFine](https://optifine.net/adloadx?f=preview_OptiFine_1.12.2_HD_U_G6_pre1.jar&x=c2f6)** (Consider using [OptiNotFine](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/optinotfine))
- **[Celeritas](https://github.com/kappa-maintainer/Celeritas-auto-build/releases)** (Requires **_Cleanroom Loader_**, use the [version 2.3.0](https://github.com/kappa-maintainer/Celeritas-auto-build/releases/download/release%2F2.3.0-dev.13-54-g9e892798-20250819T004238/celeritas-forge-mc12.2-2.3.0-dev.jar) to take advantage of baked quad optimizations (CensoredASM), or 2.4.0+ to be on latest Celeritas)
- **[Nothirium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nothirium)** (Also requires **[Naughthirium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/naughthirium)**)

::: info Note {id="note"}
**_Celeritas_** and **_Nothirium_** do decrease ram usage and footprint, while **_OptiFine_** may increase ram usage and will lengthen load times.
:::

### Stress Test Results

In a simulated heavy-base scenario, we benchmarked the aforementioned mods against each other, and therefore rank their performance according to which gpu is used: <br>
- **NVIDIA GPUs** → `Nothirium > Optifine > Celeritas`
- **AMD GPUs** → `Celeritas > Optifine > Nothirium`
- **Intel Integrated Graphics** → `Nothirium > Optifine > Celeritas` <br> <br>

::: info Note {id="note"}
Performance varies depending on your hardware and drivers. Test all three mods to see which provides the best results for your system.<br>

## MCreator and AI Generated Mods

Old and new 1.12.2 mods made with MCreator are highly not recommended for use no matter what kind of mod it is. MCreator in 1.12.2 is no longer officially supported and mods created with it have significant issues that will impact your game, such as unoptimized code, hardcoded IDs, NBT data breakage, and difficulty to debug the generated code. You can use [Crash assistant](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crash-assistant) or [MCreatorDetector](https://github.com/darklysteamgear/mcreatorDetector) if you want a quick way of finding out which mods are MCreator. <br> <br>

Mods that were created entirely using generated code from AI (rather than as a learning tool) are also highly not recommended, the mod's code will be highly varied in quality (often poor), it can also be either prone to crashes or downright placebos, especially if it is a performance related mod. <br> <br>

::: info Note {id="note"}
If you're new to mod creation and want to start making a mod, we highly recommend creating the mod from scratch instead to avoid complications with learning.
:::


## Superseded mods

::: info Note {id="note"}
These mods are not necessarily incompatible with Cleanroom loader, but have been superseded by newer forks and mods or do not present any benefit, so we recommend the following actions. <br> <br>

For forks not listed below, keep in mind that not all of them are beneficial. Some forks introduce extra bugs that were not in the original mod, some were forked mostly for a specific modpack's benefit and some were forked due to internal conflicts with the original mod's developers. Use those forks at your own discretion.
